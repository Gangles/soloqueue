Solo Queue: An Exercise in Serenity
====================================

A small interactive fiction game about the perils of teaming up with four complete strangers when playing solo queue in [*League of Legends*](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/). It's a rough attempt at game criticism via Twine parody, inspired by Dan Bruno's [*Time for some Fire Emblem*](http://danbruno.net/twine/fireemblem.html) and [my own experiences](http://www.lolking.net/summoner/na/24428525) in the season 3 ranked queue.

>__Mr. Pink__: Why can't we pick our own colors?
>
>__Joe__: No way, no way. Tried it once, doesn't work. You got four guys all fighting over who's gonna be Mr. Black, but they don't know each other, so nobody wants to back down. No way. I pick. You're Mr. Pink.
